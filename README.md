# Description
This is a portfolio website developed for the Unviersity of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. It has been built based off a proof that was providedin GIF form. The GIF did not contain demo'd functionalty for hover state or mobile responsiveness so I have used my intutition to develop these. I have taken the liberties of replacing most of the placeholder content with the exception of the hero image. This project will be iterated upon further as futher skills are developed and projects completed.
