# Description
This is a portfolio website developed for the Unviersity of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. It has been built based off a proof that was providedin GIF form. The GIF did not contain demo'd functionalty for hover state or mobile responsiveness so I have used my intutition to develop these. I have taken the liberties of replacing most of the placeholder content with the exception of the hero image. This project will be iterated upon further as futher skills are developed and projects completed. 

# Functionality 
Header Navigation: The background will hightlight in white on hover. The links are anchored to page sections with the exception of 'Resume' -- that is linked to LinkedIn. 

Featured Work: These tiles come equipped with a light blue color overlay which are dissolved on hover. Each featured tile is linked to an external source. 

Contact Me: The background will highlight in black on hover. The first two links are common contact links (tel and mailto) and the remaning three are external.
